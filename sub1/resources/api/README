Edit resources/admin/configuration.ini and fill apiAuthorizedIP in the [settings] section with the IP address of the client accessing the API:
apiAuthorizedIP="192.168.1.1"

You can set multiple IPs (comma-separated):
apiAuthorizedIP="192.168.1.1,192.168.2"

You can also set incomplete IPs so the whole range will be allowed:
apiAuthorizedIP="192.168.1"
(will authorize all IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255)

If you are trying to access the API from the machine it is installed on, you can use the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).

Hint: if you don't know which IP address will be requesting the API, just leave apiAuthorizedIP blank (apiAuthorizedIP="") and access the example form with your browser ( http://yourcoral.tld/resources/api_client/ ), you will get an error like this:
You are not authorized to use this service.
Unauthorized IP: 127.0.0.1
